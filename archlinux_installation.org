#+TITLE: My installtion process of installing Arch Linux

* Preparation
- [ ] download iso.
- [ ] prepare for partition to install
- [ ] a USB for booting the ISO.


* Burn the ISO to the USB
According to
[[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/USB_flash_installation_media][Arch
Wiki]], the ISO file can be directly =dd= into a USB flash media.

so I execute the following command to do that

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  dd bs=4M if=archlinux-2015.06.01-dual.iso of=/dev/sdb && sync
#+END_SRC

- =bs= means how many bytes =dd= would read or write at a time.
- =if= is used to specify the input file, the ISO file name is used here.
- =of= is used to specify the output file. The USB device is =/dev/sdb= in my case.
- =sync= is used to flush file system buffers to ensure that all the files are
  written to the USB flash.

Now I am waiting for the process to finish. Writing this post and learn the next
installation step.
