** awk specify FS(field seperator)
awk's internal variable =FS= defines awk's seperator, and it is
actually a regular expression. Thus, for the following sample:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
filenameA,filenameB 0
#+END_EXAMPLE
We specify different =FS=:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  awk 'BEGIN{FS = ","}{print "0="$0;print "1="$1;print "2="$2; print "3="$3}' << EOF
  filenameA,filenameB 0
  EOF
#+END_SRC

Now, use regular expression to specify both "," and "<space>" as seperator.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  awk 'BEGIN{FS = "[, ]"}{print "0="$0;print "1="$1;print "2="$2; print "3="$3}' << EOF
  filenameA,filenameB 0
  EOF
#+END_SRC

However, if =filenameB= and =0= are seperated by more than one
space, we will get more than three fields, and as we may expected,
we'll have to expand the =FS= even more:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  awk 'BEGIN{FS = "[, ]+"}{print "0="$0;print "1="$1;print "2="$2; print "3="$3}' << EOF
  filenameA, filenameB     0
  EOF
#+END_SRC

Note that, the =FS= variable can also be specified by command line
options:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  awk -F "[, ]+" '{print "0="$0;print "1="$1;print "2="$2; print "3="$3}' << EOF
  filenameA, filenameB     0
  EOF
#+END_SRC
