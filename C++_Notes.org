** How to make =static= entries global

Suppose you have an object file: =foo.o=. Then you can check symbol
table by:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  objdump -t foo.o
#+END_SRC

Output as follows:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ objdump -t lib.o

lib.o:     file format elf64-x86-64

SYMBOL TABLE:
0000000000000000 l    df *ABS*  0000000000000000 lib.c
0000000000000000 l    d  .text  0000000000000000 .text
0000000000000000 l    d  .data  0000000000000000 .data
0000000000000000 l    d  .bss   0000000000000000 .bss
0000000000000000 l     F .text  0000000000000014 add2
0000000000000000 l    d  .note.GNU-stack        0000000000000000 .note.GNU-stack
0000000000000000 l    d  .eh_frame      0000000000000000 .eh_frame
0000000000000000 l    d  .comment       0000000000000000 .comment
0000000000000014 g     F .text  0000000000000041 multiply
#+END_EXAMPLE

You can see that =add2= is local symbol which is indicated by the
flag =l=, while =multiply= is global symbol by flag =g=.

Save the symbols you want to globalized to a text file:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ cat foobar
add2
#+END_EXAMPLE

And Use =objcopy= to create a new object file for use.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  $ objcopy --globalize-symbols=foobar lib.o lib2.o
#+END_SRC

* Syntax/Compilation
** Variable and Segment
In Linux, use =nm a.out= or =objdump -t a.out= to display symbols.
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp
  int a = 1;
  int b = 0;
  int c;
  int d[] = {0,0,0,0,0};
  int e[] = {0,0,0,0,5};
  int f[5];
  static int g = 20;
  static int h;

  int main(int argc, char *argv[])
  {
      int i = 1;
      int j = 0;
      int k;
      int l[] = {0,0,0,0,0};
      int m[] = {0,0,0,0,5};
      int n[5];
      static int o = 20;
      static int p;
      return 0;
  }
#+END_SRC

Symbols as follows(Upper case means the symbol is global/external):
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
0000000000600a60 D a
0000000000600aa0 B b
0000000000600ae4 B c
0000000000600ab0 B d
0000000000600a70 D e
0000000000600ad0 B f
0000000000600a84 d g
0000000000600ac4 b h
0000000000600a88 d o.1736
0000000000600ac8 b p.1737
#+END_EXAMPLE

There are following rules.
1. All normal local variables(without static) are allocated on stack.
2. Initialized variable are stored in *Data* segment(D/d). Note
   that if a variable is initialized to =0=, it is treated as
   non-initialized(variable b, d).
3. Non-initialized variables are stored in *BSS* segment.
4. all static variables are treated as global defined variable
   except that they are not visible outside their module(file or function).

** Variable Scope
A variable is visiable immediately after its declaration:
#+BEGIN_SRC C
  #include <stdio.h>
  int a = 1;
  int b = 10;
  int main(int argc, char *argv[])
  {
      printf("%d\n", a);
      int a = 2;
      printf("%d\n", a);

      int b = b; /* b remains undefined */
      printf("%d\n", b);
      return 0;
  }

#+END_SRC

** Parameter Order
Note that the evaluation order of the parameters of C/C++ is from
right to left:
#+BEGIN_SRC C
  #include <stdio.h>

  int func1() {printf("Function 1\n"); return 1;}
  int func2() {printf("Function 2\n"); return 1;}

  void func3(int a, int b) {return;}

  int main(int argc, char *argv[])
  {
      int b = 3;
      int arr[] = {6,7,8,9,10};
      int *ptr = arr;
      printf("%d, %d\n", *ptr, *(++ptr));

      printf("%d, %d\n", func1(), func2());

      func3(func1(), func2());
      return 0;
  }

#+END_SRC

** Big/Little endian
#+BEGIN_SRC C
  #include <stdio.h>

  int main(int argc, char *argv[])
  {
      unsigned int tmp = 0x01020304;
      char *b = (char *)&tmp;
      printf("%x %x %x %x\n", *b, *(b+1), *(b+2), *(b+3));

      /* big endian    => 1 2 3 4
         little endian => 4 3 2 1 */

      return 0;
  }
#+END_SRC

** extern C
When C++ make uses of C compiled libraries =extern "C"= should be
added. This is because C++ allows function overload. Suppose we
have C function =void foo(int x, int y)=, C compiled library will
have symbol name like =_foo=, after adding =extern "C"=, C++ will
   have names like =_foo_int_int= which include its parameter information.

** mutable
=mutable= is a keyword in C++ and is used to describe class members
to allow =const= member functions to modify it.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp
  #include <iostream>
  #include <string>
  using namespace std;
  class Student{
      string Name;
      int time_of_getname;
  public:
      Student(char *name){
  	Name = name;
  	time_of_getname = 0;
      }
      string get_name() {
  	time_of_getname ++;
  	return Name;
      }
  };
  int main(int argc, char *argv[])
  {
      const Student xx("Foo Bar");
      cout << xx.get_name() << endl; // error, const object calls non-const function
      return 0;
  }
#+END_SRC

Then set =get_name= to const function and =time_of_getname= to
mutable(otherwise compilation will fail):

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp
  #include <iostream>
  #include <string>
  using namespace std;
  class Student{
      string Name;
      mutable int time_of_getname;
  public:
      Student(char *name){
  	Name = name;
  	time_of_getname = 0;
      }
      string get_name() const {
  	time_of_getname ++;
  	return Name;
      }
  };
  int main(int argc, char *argv[])
  {
      const Student xx("Foo Bar");
      cout << xx.get_name() << endl; // error, const object calls non-const function
      return 0;
  }
#+END_SRC

** sizeof
1. Empty class have size of *1 byte*.
2. If a class includes virtual function, or it uses virtual inherit
   it will add a pointer to a virtual table, thus need one more
   pointer.
3. =static= member do not count when calculating =sizeof=.
4. Other members are counted like =struct= for data alignment.
5. Derived class will have all members of its parents.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp
  #include <iostream>
  using namespace std;

  class Empty {};
  class Derived1: public Empty {};
  class Derived2: public Empty {};
  class Multiple: public Derived1, public Derived2 {};

  class A: virtual public Empty {};
  class C: public A, public Derived1 {};

  class Virtual {virtual void display() {}};

  class Static{
      int a;
      static int not_count;
  };

  class Normal{
      int i;
      char c;
      double d;
      char cc;
  };


  int main(int argc, char *argv[])
  {
      cout << "In 64bit System" << endl;
      cout << "sizeof(Empty class):\t" << sizeof(Empty) << endl;
      cout << "sizeof(Derived class):\t" << sizeof(Derived1) << endl;
      cout << "sizeof(Multiple):\t" << sizeof(Multiple) << endl;
      cout << "sizeof(Multiple of virtual):\t" << sizeof(C) << endl;
      cout << "sizeof(virtual):\t" << sizeof(Virtual) << endl;
      cout << "sizeof(Static):\t" << sizeof(Static) << endl;
      cout << "sizeof(Normal):\t" << sizeof(Normal) << endl;
      cout << "sizeof(virtual inherit):\t" << sizeof(A) << endl;
      return 0;
  }
#+END_SRC

A brief summary of struct alignment.
1. Members are aligned to the next multiplications of their size. For
   example, =short= must be aligned to =addr%2 == 0=, =double=
   should be aligned to =addr%2 == 8=, etc.
2. The size of struct is the multiple of the maximal size of its member.
3. If a struct contains another struct, the final size of the
   struct is the multiple of the maximal size of all members of the
   struct recursively.
#+BEGIN_SRC C
  /* in Linux 64-bit machine, sizeof(long double) = 16 */
  #include <stdio.h>
  struct NonEmpty {char c; long double d; char f;};
  struct Sub {
      struct NonEmpty a;
      char b;
  };

  int main(int argc, char *argv[])
  {
      printf("%d\n", sizeof(struct NonEmpty));
      printf("%d\n", sizeof(struct Sub));
      return 0;
  }
#+END_SRC

** const
C++ do not allow empty const variable while c do;
#+BEGIN_SRC C
  int main(int argc, char *argv[])
  {
      const int i;  // Compile error in C++ while OK in C
      return 0;
  }
#+END_SRC
* Classes
** Inheritance
A derived class can access all the non-private member of its base
class. Thus the base-class members that should not be accessible to
the member functions of derived class should be declared private in
the base class

| Access          | Public | Protected | Private |
|-----------------+--------+-----------+---------|
| Same class      | yes    | yes       | yes     |
| Derived classes | yes    | yes       | no      |
| Outside classes | yes    | no        | no      |

A derived class inherits all base class methods with the following
*exceptions*:
- Constructors, desctructors and copy constructors of the base
  class.
- Overloaded operators of the base class.
- The friend functions of the base class.

*References*

** Virtual Function
Virtual function come into place where member function overriding
exists. Normally, C++ will call the member function according to
the type of current object.
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp
  #include <iostream>
  using namespace std;

  class B
  {
  public:
      void display()
  	{ cout << "Content of base class.\n"; }
  };

  class D : public B
  {
  public:
      void display()
  	{cout << "Content of derived class.\n"; }
  };

  int main(int argc, char *argv[])
  {
      B *b;
      D d;
      d.display();

      b = &d; /* convert pointer to derived object to base class */
      b->display();
      return 0;
  }
#+END_SRC

Even if the object =b= points to is actually a object of class =D=,
class =B='s member function =display= is called(member function of
the class that matches the type of pointer).

Virtual function gives the programmer the capability to call member
function of different class by a same function call depending upon
different context.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp
  #include <iostream>
  using namespace std;

  class B
  {
  public:
      virtual void display()
  	{ cout << "Content of base class.\n"; }
  };

  class D1 : public B
  {
  public:
      void display()
  	{cout << "Content of first derived class.\n"; }
  };

  class D2 : public B
  {
  public:
      void display()
  	{cout << "Content of second derived class.\n"; }
  };

  int main(int argc, char *argv[])
  {
      B *b;
      B bt;
      D1 d1;
      D2 d2;

      b = &bt;
      b->display(); /* calls B's display() */

      b = &d1;
      b->display(); /* calls display() of derived class D1 */

      b = &d2;
      b->display(); /* calls display() of derived class D2 */
      return 0;
  }
#+END_SRC

In this example, =display()= function of the three classes are
called with the same code.

*pure virtual function* is declared using =virtual float area() =
   0=, Notice the =\=0= part.
If a class contains at least one pure virtual function, that class
is known as *abstract class* and cannot be instanciate.

** Virtual Destructor
If the destructor of the *Base* class is not virtual, then a *Base*
pointer to a *Derived* class will call *Base*'s destructor
only. Note that this behavior is actually *undefined*!. So even if
you have nothing to release in *Derived* class, don't do this!

Note: in a derived class, if your base class has a virtual
destructor, your own destructor is automatically virtual. You might
need an explicitly defined destructor for other reasons, but
there's no need to redeclare a destructor simply to make sure it is
virtual. No matter whether you declare it with the virtual keyword,
declare it without the virtual keyword, or don't declare it at all,
it's still virtual.

- [[http://www.gotw.ca/publications/mill18.htm][Virtuality]]

** Virtual Inheritance
Virtual inheritance is used to solve
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_problem][Diamond Problem]].

Examples of diamond problem and solution are illustrated in [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_inheritance][Virtual Inheritance]].
Here I quote the example:
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp
  class Animal {
  public:
      virtual void eat();
  };

  // Two classes virtually inheriting Animal:
  class Mammal : public virtual Animal {
  public:
      virtual void breathe();
  };

  class WingedAnimal : public virtual Animal {
  public:
      virtual void flap();
  };

  // A bat is still a winged mammal
  class Bat : public Mammal, public WingedAnimal {
  };
#+END_SRC
Normally, inheritance without virtual keyword would make =Bat= a
=<Mammal, WingedAnimal>= object. Thus there exists two instance of
the grand-class =Animal=. With virtual inheritance, =Bat= will
include only one instance of =Animal= and add some information to
=Mammal= and =WingedAnimal=, that makes =Bat= like this: =<vpointer,
   Mammal, vpointer, WingedAnimal, Bat, Animal>=.

Take the above into account when calculating the size of a class.

** constant member functions
Declaring a member function with the =const= keyword specifies that
the function is a "read-only" function that does not modify the
object for which it is called. A constant member function cannot
modify any non-static data members or call any member function that
are't constant.

It's like a mechanism to ensure that the function has no side-effect.

Note that =const= object can only call member functions that are =const=.
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp
  // constant_member_function.cpp
  class Date
  {
  public:
      Date( int mn, int dy, int yr ){
  	month = mn;
      };
      int getMonth() const;     // A read-only function
      void setMonth( int mn );   // A write function; can't be const
  private:
      int month;
  };

  int Date::getMonth() const
  {
      return month;        // Doesn't modify anything
  }
  void Date::setMonth( int mn )
  {
      month = mn;          // Modifies data member
  }
  int main()
  {
      Date MyDate( 7, 4, 1998 );
      const Date BirthDate( 1, 18, 1953 );
      MyDate.setMonth( 4 );    // Okay
      BirthDate.getMonth();    // Okay
      // BirthDate.setMonth( 4 ); // C2662 Error <=
  }
#+END_SRC

** Named Constructor Idiom
[[http://www.parashift.com/c%2B%2B-faq-lite/named-ctor-idiom.html][What is the "Named Constructor Idiom"]]
Named constructor idiom provide more intuitive and/or safer
construction operation for user of your code. It can also be used
to generate objects when you make your constructor private.
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp
  class Base
  {
      Base(){}
  public:
      static Base generate(){ return Base(); }
  };


  int main(int argc, char *argv[])
  {
      // Base b; // Error due to private constructor.
      Base b = Base::generate();
      return 0;
  }
#+END_SRC
** Default Constructor

There are four characteristics of a class under which the compiler
needs to sythesize a default constructor for classes that declare
no constructor at all. They are called implicit nontrivial default
constructors. The synthesized constructor fulfills only
implemention need instead of program need. These characteristics are:

1. Class that has member class object with default constructor.
2. Class is derived from base class with default constructor.
3. Class has virtual member function.
4. Class with a virtual base class.

Classes that do not exhibit these characteristics and declares no
constructor at all are said to have implicit trivial default
constructors. In practice, these tirvial constructors might not be
synthesized at all.

Note that if you've declared a constructor manually, the system
will not generate one default for you any more.

So, if you make your constructor private, the derived class will
try to generate a constructor that calls the base class's
constructor which is private and invalid to call outside the base
class. So as to prevent your class from inheriting.

*references*
- "Inside the C++ Object Model" Section 2.1.

** Copy constructor
Under three situations will copy constructor be used.
1. Assign an object to another.
2. Passing an object as the parameter of a function by value.
3. Returning an object from a function.

**** Default Memberwise Initialization
Each class object initialized with another object of its class
is initialized by what is called default memberwise
initialization.

If the class do not provide an explicit copy constructor, the new
object will be initialized by memberwise copy. That means all
members(except member class object) are directly be assigned to
the value of the old object(pointer/array, etc). Member class
objects are copied recursively using memberwise initialization.

**** Bitwise Copy Semantics
"In practice, a good compiler generate bitwise copies for most
class object since they have bitwise copy semantics.

When are bitwise copy semantics not exhibited by a class?
1. When the class have a member object of a class which a copy
   constructor exists.(either explictly defined by the class
   designer or sythesized by the compiler)
2. The class is derived from a base class for which a copy
   constructor exists(again, either defined or sythesized).
3. When a class declares one or more virtual function.
4. When a class is derived from an inheritance chain in which one
   or more base classes are virtual(virtual inheritance).

Case 1,2 the implementation will need to insert invocations of
the member or base class copy constructor inside the synthesized
copy constructor.

**** Resetting the Virtual Table Pointer
Normally, if two objects belong to the same class, bitwise copy
can be applied, even if they contain virtual functions.
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp
  class ZooAnimal { 
  public: 
     ZooAnimal(); 
     virtual ~ZooAnimal(); 

     virtual void animate(); 
     virtual void draw(); 
     // ... 
  private: 
     // data necessary for ZooAnimal's 
     // version of animate() and draw() 
  }; 

  class Bear : public ZooAnimal { 
  public: 
     Bear(); 

     void animate(); 
     void draw(); 
     virtual void dance(); 
     // ... 
  private: 
     // data necessary for Bear's version 
     // of animate(), draw(), and dance() 
  }; 
  Bear yogi;
  Bear winnie = yogi; // Bitwise copy is sufficiant

  ZooAnimal franny = yogi; // vptr should be re-constructed
#+END_SRC
However, =vptr= should be correctly reset when initializing an
object using a pointer to a derived class. Because =yogi='s
=draw()= function points to =Bear= while =franny= is a
=ZooAnimal= and its =show()= should points to class =ZooAnimal=.
** Member Initialization List
You may initialize members using member initialization list or
within constructor, execpt four conditions your choice is insignificant.

You MUST use member initialization list under the following first 3
conditions:
1. When initializing a reference member;
2. When initializing a const member;
3. When invoking a base or member class constructor with a set of arguments.
4. Member initialization is faster.

Note that the initialization order of member initailization list is
the order of member declaration instead of member initialization
list order. This may lead to some subtle bug.
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp
  class A{
  private:
      int i;
      int j;
  public:
      A(val): j(val),i(j){} //bug.
  };
#+END_SRC
However, the member initialization list code comes before any user
code, thus the following code is correct.
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp
  class A{
  private:
      int i;
      int j;
  public:
      A(val): j(val){
  	i = j;
      }
  };
#+END_SRC
An advice: put code that initialize a member using another object
inside constructor body. This will aovid ambiguous to some extent.

** Data Member Layout
1. The Standard requires within an access section (the private,
   public, or protected section of a class declaration) only that
   the members be set down such that "later members have higher
   addresses within a class object"
2. The compiler will also synthesize data member to support Object
   Model. =vptr= is such an example. Traditionally they are placed
   after all explicitly declared members. Recently they are placed
   at the beginning of the class object. It is implementation
   dependent.
