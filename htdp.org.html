<span class="org-document-info-keyword"><span class="hl-line">#+TITLE:</span></span><span class="hl-line"> </span><span class="org-document-title"><span class="hl-line">How to Design Programs Notes
</span></span>
<span class="org-level-1">* Design Functions</span>
<span class="org-level-2">** Information and Data</span>
Information can be thought as facts about the program's domain, while data is
just a "literal" representation.

Take temperature as an example. `100` is only a prepresentation or data. We
know nothing only by looking at this literal. When the data is `interpretted`
in the domain of temperature, we know it means 100C or 100F. On the other
hand, computers or programs cannot understand 100C or 100F directly. We then
can `represent` it as a number `100` or strings link `100C` or `100F`, these are
what computers can understand.

<span class="org-level-2">** Process of Designing Functions</span>
<span class="bold">*-&gt;*</span> This process can be guideline of writing comments for functions.

- Express how information is represented as data.
<span class="org-block-begin-line">  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
</span><span class="org-block">  ; we use plain numbers to represent temperatures.
</span><span class="org-block-end-line">  #+END_EXAMPLE
</span>- Write down a signature, a purpose statement, and a function header.
  A <span class="underline">_signature_</span> is like `haskell`'s function type.
<span class="org-block-begin-line">  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
</span><span class="org-block">  ; String -&gt; Number
</span><span class="org-block-end-line">  #+END_EXAMPLE
</span>  <span class="underline">_Purpose statement_</span> is a short line to describe the purpose of a function. A
  better way to express this is to use descriptive names for functions.
  <span class="underline">_Function Header_</span> is the header of a function without its implementation.
- Illustrate the signature and the purpose statement with some functional
  examples.
<span class="org-block-begin-line">  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
</span><span class="org-block">  ; Number -&gt; Number                                      ; signature
  ; compute the area of a square whose side is len        ; purpose
  ; given: 2, expect: 4                                   ; examples
  ; given: 7, expect: 49
  (define (area-of-square len) 0)                         ; header
</span><span class="org-block-end-line">  #+END_EXAMPLE
</span>
- The next step is considering what and how are we going to compute. This is
  done by inserting <span class="bold">*templates*</span> in the function body(for example, the ones
  introduced in the following chapters).
- Now <span class="underline">_code_</span>. Fill in the information needed by the template and other
  details.
- Last one: Test the functions. (in racket or other script languages, directly
  make some unit test cases is quite simple, do it!)
  
<span class="org-level-2">** Domain Knowledge</span>
   Two forms of <span class="underline">_domain knowledge_</span>:
   - Knowledge from external domains.
   - Knowledge about the library functions in the chosen programming language.

<span class="org-level-3">*** From Functions to Programs</span>
The `car` problem: Design a program that moves a car across the world canvas,
from left to right, at the rate of three pixels per clock tick.

How to tare down the problem into program elements:
- Find out constant staff and assign them to global constant variables.
- Find out properties that change over time. Design how to represent them with
  data. (can we call them <span class="underline">_states_</span>?)
- Design a number of functions to handle al these variable properties.
- write a <span class="underline">_main_</span> function so as to connect real world to our programs.

<span class="org-level-1">* Lists</span>

<span class="org-block-begin-line">  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
</span>    Then again, if this list is supposed to represent a record with a fixed
    number of pieces, use a structure type instead.<span class="org-meta-line">
</span><span class="org-block-end-line">  #+END_QUOTE
</span>    
This means that when designing programs, use lists oly when the number of
items is variable. Otherwise, choose <span class="underline">_struct_</span>, <span class="underline">_vector_</span>, etc. instead.

<span class="org-level-1">* Designing With Self-referential Data Definitions</span>

This chapter talks about the design of new self-referential data(or
recursively defined data). And how to walk through all the elements of a
specific data.

Also the book gave out a "template" for designing functions for
self-referential data.

<span class="bold">*-&gt;*</span> Most data structures comes with a patter, and there also exists a pattern
 of how to deal with it. This is what we called a template.
