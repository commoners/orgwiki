<span class="org-level-2">** How to find components by ID?</span>
(These contexts are copied from the link below)

A search expression consists of either an identifier (which is matched
exactly against the id property of a UIComponent, or a series of such
identifiers linked by the UINamingContainer#getSeparatorChar character
value. The search algorithm should operates as follows, though
alternate alogrithms may be used as long as the end result is the
same:

- Identify the UIComponent that will be the base for searching, by
  stopping as soon as one of the following conditions is met:
  - If the search expression begins with the the separator character 
    (called an "absolute" search expression), the base will be the
    root UIComponent of the component tree. The leading separator
    character will be stripped off, and the remainder of the search
    expression will be treated as a "relative" search expression as
    described below.
  - Otherwise, if this UIComponent is a NamingContainer it will serve
    as the basis.
  - Otherwise, search up the parents of this component. If a
    NamingContainer is encountered, it will be the base.
- Otherwise (if no NamingContainer is encountered) the root
  UIComponent will be the base.
  - The search expression (possibly modified in the previous step) is
    now a "relative" search expression that will be used to locate the
    component (if any) that has an id that matches, within the scope
    of the base component. The match is performed as follows:
  - If the search expression is a simple identifier, this value is
    compared to the id property, and then recursively through the
    facets and children of the base UIComponent (except that if a
    descendant NamingContainer is found, its own facets and children
    are not searched).
  - If the search expression includes more than one identifier
    separated by the separator character, the first identifier is used
    to locate a NamingContainer by the rules in the previous bullet
    point. Then, the findComponent() method of this NamingContainer
    will be called, passing the remainder of the search expression.

Check the following link for the rules of finding components.

<span class="org-level-2">** How is the beans connected with UI components?</span>

It seems that when some actions are taken and the bean is updated
then the UI will be updated also.

<span class="org-level-2">** where does JSF validate the input?</span>
JSF as it is, <span class="bold">*always perform the validation on server side*</span>. The
input validation is a part of component lifecycle. The validation that
feels like client-side validation is when we use Ajax support in
JSF. It submits only the necessary part of fields and they are still
validated on the server side.
