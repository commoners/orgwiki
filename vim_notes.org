** how to swap two strings?
For example, we have a code snippets with two identifiers: =tmp_1= and
=tmp_2=, then we want to swap them in all occurrences. Like
implementing =swap= in normal programming languages, we can:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
:s/tmp_1/tmp_X/g
:s/tmp_2/tmp_1/g
:s/tmp_X/tmp_2/g
#+END_EXAMPLE
This method is inefficient and killing. There is a plugin named
=abolish= which enhances the substitution utilities, with its help, we
can simply type:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
:S/{tmp_1,tmp_2}/{tmp_2,tmp_1}/g
#+END_EXAMPLE
Note the upper case =S=.
