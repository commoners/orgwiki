#+TITLE: Test Org Syntax
* This is the index file
This repos aimed at demonstrating how to export org files to html.

* Example Contents
** WATING Head 2                                                :HOME:OFFICE:
*** Heading 3
This is a sample paragraph.

** TODO Head 2
we'll have embeded code here: =(apply + '(1 2 3 4))=.

Here we'll include a list.

- item 1
  - subitem 1
  - subitem 2
- item 2
  1. ordered item 1
  2. ordered item 2
     - mixed item 1
     - mixed item 2
     HELLO :: This is a description node
     WORLD :: another one.
  3. ordered item 3.
- item 3

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Some example from a text file.
#+END_EXAMPLE

Another plain inline example:
Here is an example
: Some example from a text file.


* Links
File links ended with `org` will be converted to html.
remember

Image link:
#+CAPTION: This is the caption for the next figure link (or table)
#+NAME: fig:SED-HR4049
[[file:image/test.jpg]]

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun org-xor (a b)
    "Exclusive or."
    (if a (not b) b))
#+END_SRC

* Test of footer
this is a paragraph [fn:1]

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp -n -r
  (save-excursion                  (ref:sc)
     (goto-char (point-min)))      (ref:jump)
#+END_SRC
In line [[(sc)]] we remember the current position.  Line [[(jump)]]
jumps to point-min.[fn:2]

[fn:1] This is still a test.

[fn:2] Another footnote.

* insert math
This is also a test.
\begin{equation}
x=\sqrt{b}
\end{equation}

If $a^2=b$ and \( b=2 \), then the solution must be
either $$ a=+\sqrt{2} $$ or \[ a=-\sqrt{2} \].
