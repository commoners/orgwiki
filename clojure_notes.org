** Namespaces
The information in this chapter is mainly from book "The Joy of
Clojure" Chapter 2.

Please check the document of [[https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/ns][ns]] for more infomation.

*** Create namespaces using ns
#+begin_src clojure
  (ns joy.ch2)
#+end_src
Also, in CIDER REPL, =C-c M-n= is binded to switch namespaces.

*** Loading other namespaces with :require
#+begin_src clojure
  (ns joy.req
    (:require clojure.set))

  ;;; or use an alias
  (ns joy.req-alias
    (:require [clojure.set :as s]))
#+end_src

*** Loading and creating mappings with :use
#+begin_src clojure
  (ns joy.use-ex
    (:use [clojure.string :only [capitalize]]))
#+end_src
In this way we add a new function =capitalize= to current
function. Then we are able to use it without refer to its full name
=clojure.string.capitalize= every time.

We can also import all symbols of a namespace and exclude some of them
by:
#+begin_src clojure
  (ns joy.exclusion
    (:use [clojure.string :exclude [capitalize]]))
#+end_src
Note that the above code will give some warnings. This is because
=clojure.string= defines =reverse= and =replace= functions that had
already exists in the =clojure.core= namespace. Therefore, when either
of those functions are used, the last Var definition wins:

#+begin_src clojure
  (reverse "abc")
  ; => "cba"
  (clojure.core/reverse "abc")
  ; => (\c \b \a)
#+end_src

*** Creating mappings with :refer
=:refer= works almost exactly like =:use= except that it only creates
mappings for libraries that have already been loaded:
#+begin_src clojure
  (ns joy.yet-another
    (:refer joy.ch1)
    (:refer joy.ch2 :rename {hello hi}))
#+end_src

Actually, =:use= is a wrapper of =:require= and =:refer= which first
load the namespace and later add the mappings to current namespace.

*** Loading Java classes with :import
#+begin_src clojure
  (ns joy.java
    (:import [java.util HashMap]
             [java.util.concurrent.atomic AtomicLong]))
#+end_src
As a reminder, any classes in Java =java.lang= package are
automatically imported when namespaces are created.

** Truthiness
Every value looks like =true= to =if=, except for =false= and =nil=.
#+begin_src clojure
  (if true :truthy :falsey) ;=> :truthy
  (if [] :truthy :falsey)   ;=> :truthy
  (if nil :truthy :falsey) ;=> :falsey
  (if false :truthy :falsey) ;=> :falsey
#+end_src
