#+TITLE: Git 笔记

* Tasks
** Change commit message of past git commits.
To change the most recent commit message, use =git commit
--amend=. Change message of (unpushed) commits further in the past,

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  git rebase -i [COMMIT BEFORE THE FIRST YOU WANT TO EDIT]
#+END_SRC

Mark all messages to be changed with "edit". Git will start the
rebasing and stop at every marked commit. For each of those, do a =git
commit –amend -m 'new messag'= and =git rebase --continue=

** ignore changes in tracked file
I am facing the situation that I need to change some configuration
file locally, and don't want it to be tracked by git. 

A direct though would be adding it to =.gitignore=, which however
will not work. Git will track a file once it is tracked.

So
[[http://blog.pagebakers.nl/2009/01/29/git-ignoring-changes-in-tracked-files/][here]]
is the solution:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  git update-index --assume-unchanged <file>

  # If you wanna start tracking changes again run the following command:
  git update-index --no-assume-unchanged <file>
#+END_SRC
That is it!
