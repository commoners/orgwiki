** Change commit message of past git commits.
To change the most recent commit message, use =git commit
--amend=. Change message of (unpushed) commits further in the past,

#+begin_src bash
 git rebase -i [COMMIT BEFORE THE FIRST YOU WANT TO EDIT]
#+end_src

Mark all messages to be changed with "edit". Git will start the
rebasing and stop at every marked commit. For each of those, do a =git
commit –amend -m 'new messag'= and =git rebase --continue=
