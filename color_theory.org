limit the selection of colors by choosing three hues from the primary
palette and one accent color from the secondary pallete.
#+END_QUOTE

And according to [1], we need a "primary color" for brand; a darker
version for status bar and contextual app bars; and an accent color
for UI controls like checkboxes and text fields.


And Use opacity for text, icons, and dividers.

| type                 | black on white | white on black |
|----------------------+----------------+----------------|
| text                 |            87% |           100% |
| secondary text/Icons |            54% |            70% |
| Disabled/Hint Text   |            26% |            30% |
| Dividers             |            12% |            12% |

These are for black(#000) and white(#FFF) colors. For black/white text
on colored background, check the color palette.

This rule however gives us some information:
1. Never use pure white or black(except for 100% white).
2. Normally keep using black or white for texts.
3. Choose black or white text depending on the background color.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
use the accent color for your primary action button and components
like switches or slides.
#+END_QUOTE

A very important message from the examples on the web page is that
accent colors are used in small area for grabbing the user's
attention, usually used for primary actions.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
If your accent color is too light or dark to sufficiently contrast
with the background color, use a darker or lighter tint of the accent
color instead. If your accent color doesnâ€™t work at all, use the 500
version of your primary color on white backgrounds. If your background
color is the 500 version of your primary color, make your accent color
either white 100% or black 54%.
#+END_QUOTE

So the key point here is to ensure enough contrast between the
background and the accent color. Also note the *54% black*, another
clue of avoiding usage of pure black.

*** Use the 60-30-10 Rule.
Human tends to see an overall theme in the 60 percent hue, unifying
the coloration. The 30 percent provides visual interest and the 10
percent, not unlike jewelry, provides that little spark of sparkle.

So:
- 60% of a dominant color -- primary color
- 30% of a secondary color
- 10% of an accent color
*** Don't forget the black.
Adding small piece of black will claify and enhance all the other colors.
