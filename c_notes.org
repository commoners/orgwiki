** How to cast function pointer
The requirement is as follows: If you got a function that need a
callback function:
#+begin_src c
  void process(void (*callback)(void *))
#+end_src
Note here that callback can have one argument which is type =void
*=. Now perhaps we have our own version of callback function which
takes a =char *= argument:
#+begin_src c
  void my_callback(char *msg)
  {
      printf("%s\n", msg);
  }
#+end_src
When we want to feed =my_callback= to function =process=, the compiler
will report warning.

In short, the behavior of casting function pointers(no matter explict
or not) is undefined. However in practice, if the function parameters
are pointer type, they are of the same size, just like the case
above. So it will work but that is non-standard.
